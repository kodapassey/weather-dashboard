# weather-dashboard

#Description:
The weather dashboard is my week 7 bootcamp challenge made with html, css, javascript and web API's.
When the user searches for a city they are presented with the date and current weather conditions for that city containing tempreature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index.
The user is also presented with a 5 day forecast for that city containing the same weather info.

#Software: 
For this project I used HTML, CSS javascript and (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) - This is the API used for this project
